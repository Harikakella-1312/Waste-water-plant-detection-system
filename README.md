Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) Detection System
Overview
The Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) Detection System is an AI-powered solution designed to detect and monitor wastewater treatment facilities using satellite imagery. Leveraging deep learning techniques, this system aims to assist environmental agencies, urban planners, and researchers in identifying WWTPs for infrastructure planning, environmental monitoring, and compliance verification.

Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on satellite images to identify WWTPs with high accuracy.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides an application (wwtp_detection_app.py) that allows users to input satellite images and receive detection results.

Configurable Thresholds: Includes a threshold_config.txt file to adjust detection sensitivity based on specific requirements.

Pre-trained Model: Comes with a pre-trained model (wwtp_detection_model.h5) for immediate use without the need for retraining.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Harikakella-1312/Waste-water-plant-detection-system.git
cd Waste-water-plant-detection-system
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If requirements.txt is not present, install the necessary packages manually based on the imports in wwtp_detection_app.py.

Usage
Prepare Your Satellite Images:

Collect satellite images in a supported format (e.g., JPEG, PNG) that you wish to analyze.

Run the Detection Application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python wwtp_detection_app.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to input your images and receive detection results.

Adjust Detection Thresholds (Optional):

Modify the threshold_config.txt file to fine-tune the detection sensitivity according to your needs.
